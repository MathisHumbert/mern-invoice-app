# Frontend Mentor - MERN Invoice app

This project comes from the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl) site. The goal is to create a site that manages users' invoices. So I decided to code this project myself using React for the front end and NodeJS for the back end.
